Please add any additional notes hereâ€¦

I changed some of the import statements to require during setup as a trouble shooting step.

wrote each test before attempting to solve the test to make sure that the test was able to fail

each endpoint was worked on in it's own git branch to allow work to be done without fear of introducing errors to the main branch, would normally have deleted branches when complete, but thought I would leave them incase you wanted to see the workflow

if given more time i would have like to have edited the test for the get cards by id endpoint to check that the returned pages have a valid template id

The sizes data json is identical to the cards json, if given more time i would have fixed to match up the size ids with a title
